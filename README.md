## Introduction 🌐

In the digital landscape of online shopping and virtual platforms, customer feedback holds considerable influence over how a product is perceived and ultimately chosen by consumers. Recognizing and improving products based on this feedback is crucial, given its impact on consumer decisions. This presents an ideal opportunity for AI to sift through vast amounts of product reviews, identifying both significant flaws and notable strengths. Subsequently, this insight assists manufacturers in refining their focus when enhancing their product offerings.

One such initiative is the "Sentiment Analyzer" project, a Python application leveraging the TextBlob library to conduct sentiment analysis on text inputs. The `sentimentAnalyzer` function within this project assesses the sentiment of provided text, categorizing it as "positive," "negative," or "neutral" based on polarity scores calculated by TextBlob.

This algorithm is then applied to Amazon Reviews data. After cleaning the data, the sentiment analysis function is employed, and the resulting sentiments are analyzed and presented through various graphical representations.

## Installation ⚙️

To set up this project, clone the repository and execute the `sentimentAnalyzer` function, providing a text string as input. The function will yield the sentiment of the text, returned as a string.
